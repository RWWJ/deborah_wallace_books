        <h1>Deborah Wallace</h1>
        <p>
          Deborah Wallace writes in a number of genres, Romance, Paranormal Romance and Romantic Suspense.
        </p>

        <p>
          Someone suggested Deborah try writing, and stories started populating her brain, begging to be written.
        </p>
        <p>
          She’s been called a Jane-of-all-trades, from seamstress to house and furniture designer/builder to computer programmer to technical writer and bookkeeper. She even does car maintenance. She’s also guided a team of ‘Future Problem Solvers’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deborah grew up in Michigan, but Massachusetts has been her home for more years than she cares to think about. She loves the history, the museums and antique houses, the seacoast and hiking trails.
       </p>
        <p>
          Her three children have grown and scattered, but her husband is by her side, encouraging her writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her books are available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deborah-Wallace/e/B07XDL4X89">
