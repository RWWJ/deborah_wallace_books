<title> Abby's Salem Legacy
<genre> Paranormal Romance – witches


Her special powers have attracted a mysterious group who threaten her life. One man is determined to keep her safe.

Abby Ballard has crushed on Eric from the first time she saw him spar at her Taekwondo class when she was seventeen. Now twenty-two, she’s attacked for her blood in the studio parking lot, and Eric comes to her rescue. Maybe now that he’s noticed her she has a chance with him.

Eric Mossberg has watched over Abby since she started her first class. It’s been harder lately being the detached self-appointed watchdog when he can’t keep his gaze off the beautiful woman she’s become. After coming to her defense, he won’t stay away any longer.

What do the attackers want with Abby’s blood? Do they know she has powers? After learning about a string of puzzling deaths involving others with special abilities, Abby and Eric begin to search deeper into who wants these people dead and why.

Protecting Abby becomes Eric’s number one priority, but this menace may threaten everyone Abby holds dear.
