<title> Keith's Return
<genre> Paranormal Romance – witches

He's starting over. She's running from her ex.

When Tammy's boyfriend talks her into using her magic ability to predict the lottery numbers, and he only wins fifty grand, he pushes her to try again. She refuses, and after he hits her, she escapes to the town her brother lives in.

A scandal ended Keith's stint as an Army Ranger, but he wanted out anyway. With his evil mother dead, he's free to contact the cousin he hasn't seen in seventeen years and decides to move near his last remaining relative.

Is it fate that drew Tammy and Keith to the same security agency for work? He doesn't know, but his attraction to her surpasses anything he's experienced before. When a threat walks through the door, he'll do anything to protect her, including move her into his home.

Tammy thought she was done with her ex, but the trouble has barely begun. Keith protects her, and boy can that man kiss, but is she ready to trust another man with her heart?
