If the scars on her body tell her anything, it�s that she doesn�t want to return to her forgotten life...

 From the moment Sheriff Jake Hamilton finds the dirty, battered woman in a stolen crashed van, he�s compelled to protect her. Once she awakens from a coma, Jake�s concern for her safety prompts him to hide her on his ranch while secretly piecing together her dark past.

 Sam has no memory except her first name. Jake is the only man who doesn�t send dread pulsing through her. She blossoms in the new life Jake is helping her create, but there�s that fear though, that someone from her old life still wants her dead.

 Can Jake protect Sam or will her past come back to destroy her?
