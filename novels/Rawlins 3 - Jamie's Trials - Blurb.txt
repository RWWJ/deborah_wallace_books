It’s hard to keep a deadly secret when your life depends on revealing it…

Theron overhears two men discussing kidnapping his best friend, Jamie, the woman he’s in love with. He races to her home in Rawlins, to protect her.

Jamie’s sexy dream, starring Theron, makes her realize he’s more than her best friend. Then he shows up at her parents’ door, ready to do anything to keep her safe. Despite their best efforts, Jamie is kidnapped.

Jamie’s kidnapper wants her to use the special powers that she’s vowed to never use. If she doesn’t, he may kill the man she’s imprisoned with, but if she helps the kidnapper reach his goals, others may die.

Her only hope is that she can stay alive long enough for Theron to find her.
