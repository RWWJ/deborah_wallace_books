A town with deadly secrets…

Kathleen Rawlins inherits the estate of an unknown uncle and moves to Rawlins. The first of many powers she develops is a vision of the town’s founders fleeing Salem Village in 1693. Then there are the dreams about a man named Reese.

 Reese’s dreams of Kathleen don’t prepare him for the impact of meeting her or the overwhelming need to protect her.

 Mysterious deaths of young women have hit the news, and Kathleen and Reese connect them to centuries of murders in Rawlins. They grow closer as they research the evil history hidden within the peaceful town.

Kathleen’s ancestors failed to eradicate the power hungry killers. The only way she can have a life with Reese is if they can finish the job before she becomes the next victim.
