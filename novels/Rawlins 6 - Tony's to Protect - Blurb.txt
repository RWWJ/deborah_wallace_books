<title> Tony's To Protect
<genre> Paranormal Romance – witches

When his instant family is targeted by evil, he’ll use all his skills to keep them safe.

Life was tough when Bryanna’s boyfriend died, leaving her two months pregnant. She left Boston and moved to the small town of Rawlins where things are a little strange. Some residents are like her and have special powers. It’s the perfect place to raise her twin daughters who likely have powers too.

Tony Ballard grew up in Rawlins, knows many of its secrets, and has a few of his own. When he saves a toddler with his abilities, he meets the woman of his dreams, literally. Bryanna starred in his way-too-sexy dreams, and he realizes the dreams were premonitions.

Family isn’t always welcome. Bryanna’s kids’ great-aunt arrives in town. The woman has wicked plans for the girls, but not if Tony has anything to say about it. He will do anything to protect the woman he’s fallen in love with and her daughters.
