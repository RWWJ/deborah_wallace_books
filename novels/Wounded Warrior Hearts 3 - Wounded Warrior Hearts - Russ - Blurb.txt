<genre> Clean Romance

Some men return from war with visible wounds, others with a compulsion to continue risking their lives...

Corporal Russ Dresher can’t get enough of the thrill of free solo climbing—climbing cliff faces with no ropes. His family wouldn’t approve, but he is compelled to face that danger.

When Russ crosses paths with Vivian, who is facing her own dangers, he rushes in to help. Vivian is at first grateful, then apprehensive. She knows she needs the protection, but she has had enough of men controlling her life. Yet, with those trying to kill her evading the police, Russ may be her only hope of surviving.

Can two damaged people overcome their pasts and find the love they need in each other?
