He broke her heart, but he’s the only one who can keep her safe from a serial killer…

After she’s attacked during her run, Shannon is forced to face the cop ex-boyfriend who responds to the 911 call. It’s taken four painful years to overcome Luke’s betrayal. She won’t give him the chance to destroy her again.

Leaving Shannon was the worst mistake of Luke’s life. He came back home to beg her forgiveness, but she shut him down. Against her wishes, he joins her on her morning runs to protect her from the serial killer who nearly kidnapped her. And maybe he can convince her to give him second chance.

He works the case, cringing at the brutality of each death, desperate to solve the murders before the killer attempts to take Shannon again.

Will he get the chance to prove his love?
