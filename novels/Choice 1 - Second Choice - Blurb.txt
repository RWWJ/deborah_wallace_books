Shannon didn’t know which was worse...

being attacked in the woods during her run, or having her ex-boyfriend respond to the 911 call. It had taken over a year to get her life on track after Luke left. She wouldn’t recover if he left her again, so she had to make sure he didn’t get too close.

 Leaving Shannon was the worst mistake of Luke’s life. He was back to reclaim her, but to do that he needed to spend time with her before begging for forgiveness. Fortunately, or unfortunately, he’d get that chance, at Shannon’s side on her morning runs, protecting her from the serial killer who’d nearly kidnapped her. He worked the case, seeing the brutality of each death, desperate to solve the murders before the killer attempted to take Shannon again.
