Someone's trying to kill her, and there's only one man she wants to keep her safe.

Summer can't help the way her heart pounds whenever she's near Noah. But she should be spending time with the father she just found, not his stepson.

Noah's life is exactly the way he wants it. Then she shows up. Because all his relationships have ended badly, he tries to ignore his attraction to Summer. However, it's not long before he can't stay away from her.

But the man trying to kill Summer's mother may have switched targets. And Noah will do anything to keep the woman he's fallen for safe.
