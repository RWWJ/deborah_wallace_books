A premonition has never been so important…

After months of therapy, Adam Richards has recovered from his lifelong obsession with Jamie Ballard. He’s ready to start a fresh life, but he has a premonition of a woman who will die at his brother’s hands if he doesn’t find and rescue her.

Trill Song awakens from a spell induced haze to find herself five months pregnant, with a stranger trying to convince her she needs to run from her home or die. She peeks into his terror filled vision, packs a bag and runs with him. But it isn’t long before Adam’s brother tracks them down and they have to run again.

Trill and Adam must use every bit of their abilities and spells to stay ahead of his brother. But he has too many tricks and they can't run forever. 

This book can be read alone, but some characters are introduced in the preceding books.
