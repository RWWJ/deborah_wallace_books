A life she can't remember.
<b>A husband who's a stranger.</b>

<i><b>Again.</b></i>
 
After a car accident leaves her with amnesia, Jane thought she'd been rescued by her loving husband, Tim. But according to the photo ID in his safe, she's Emily Turner-and the only life she knows is a lie.
 
Derrick Turner has grieved his wife's disappearance for nearly two years, not knowing if she's dead or alive. So, he's overjoyed when Emily knocks on his door, even if she doesn't remember him or their daughter.
 
Despite her memory loss, Emily is happier in her new home than she ever remembers being. But there's something Derrick's not telling her, and she's afraid it will be worse than the life she escaped.
 
As Emily and Derrick struggle to resurrect their marriage, the past claws at them both. Tim has disappeared, but they know he's watching, waiting for just one mistake...
