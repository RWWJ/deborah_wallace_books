Evil comes in many disguises…

Jason is attracted to his new assignment, Shauna, like supernaturally attracted. He’s supposed to protect her from her killer ex-fiancé, but maybe someone needs to protect her from him. He fears his ability will magically siphon her powers, possibly turning him evil. His growing attraction to Shauna may prove a temptation he’s not strong enough to resist.

Shauna’s magical abilities are awakened in Rawlins. Her grandmother’s spirit warns her she’ll need them to protect herself—most likely from Jason. But she can’t believe the man she’s falling in love with would hurt her.

As magic spells attack Jason, Shauna must trust her new abilities to protect him. With danger closing in from all sides, will they be able to save each other?
