Serial Killer. Stalker. Perfect time for love?

 The wife of a serial killer. That’s what most people see when looking at Susan Argyle. Her life had been turned inside out six months ago, but she’s recovering. Until a rabbit shows up on her doorstep with a knife through its heart. The attached note says, You’re next Murderer. Her instant response is to call the detective with the kind eyes.

 Police Detective Gary Wassman had found Susan’s strength appealing when he told her that her husband had been arrested for a string of murders. Now months later, she has a stalker with murderous intent, and Gary will do anything necessary to protect her. Can he also convince this damaged woman that she can take a chance on love again?
